This is a fork of a mirror of http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1457

The fork makes the script also work on Windows.  Of course, it still doesn't work
if any of your colorscheme file names have regex special characters in them.  It
will cycle back to the beginning when it hits one of those, probably

This script provides a function, CycleColor (which is mapped to F4), to cycle through (almost) all available colorschemes.  It includes colorschemes from all \"colors\" subdirectories in the runtimepath.

Because the script uses \":colorscheme\" rather than \":source\" to set the colorscheme, if there are two files with the same name in different directories in rtp, only the first one will be used (thus \"almost\" above).

The script was inspired by a one-liner by Tim Chase.
